# Gas Profiling and Budget Review

This document describes the gas (CPU and Memory) costs for the Fluxora streaming contract.

## WASM Size Budgets

Every CI build compiles all three contracts to `wasm32-unknown-unknown --release` and asserts
that the resulting artifact stays within its byte budget. A contract that exceeds its budget
fails the `wasm-size-budget` CI job.

Budgets were set with **~25% headroom** above the sizes measured during the June 2026 baseline
audit. Soroban's practical upload ceiling is ~100 KiB after Brotli compression; raw WASM budgets
are intentionally more conservative to leave room for future features and keep upload fees low.

| Contract | Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fluxora_stream` | 256 KiB (262 144 bytes) | Largest contract; full streaming surface area |
| `fluxora_factory` | 128 KiB (131 072 bytes) | Policy wrapper; should stay small |
| `fluxora_governance` | 128 KiB (131 072 bytes) | Minimal timelock; should stay small |

### Enforcement

The `script/check-wasm-size.sh` script implements the check:

```bash
# Check raw release artifacts (run locally after a WASM build):
bash script/check-wasm-size.sh

# Check optimized artifacts (after running stellar contract optimize):
bash script/check-wasm-size.sh --optimized
```

The `wasm-size-budget` CI job:
1. Builds all three contracts with `cargo build --release --workspace --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
2. Runs `stellar contract optimize` on each artifact (best-effort; failures are non-fatal).
3. Calls `script/check-wasm-size.sh` — **fails the job** if any artifact exceeds its budget.

### Updating a Budget

If a deliberate, reviewed feature addition requires more space:

1. Land the feature and measure the new raw size locally.
2. Add ~25% headroom to the measured size, rounding up to the nearest 64 KiB boundary.
3. Update the budget constant in `script/check-wasm-size.sh`.
4. Update the table above with the new value and a note explaining the change.
5. Include the change in the PR description.

### Per-PR Delta Reporting

Every build also compares the current WASM sizes against the **previous release tag**
(most recent `v*` tag) and prints a byte-delta for each contract. This makes incremental
bloat from individual PRs visible immediately, without waiting for the absolute ceiling
to be approached.

**How it works:**

1. The script finds the most recent `v*` tag in the repository.
2. For each contract, it reads the WASM file size at that tag from git history.
3. It computes `current_size - previous_size` and prints the result.
4. In GitHub Actions CI, `::warning::` annotations are emitted when a contract grows
   and `::notice::` annotations when it shrinks. These annotations appear on the PR
   timeline **without failing the build** (budget enforcement still runs independently).

**Example output:**

```
Previous release tag: v0.9.0
  vs v0.9.0: +1234 bytes (+1.2 KiB) (was 200000 / 195.3 KiB)
fluxora_stream: 201234 bytes (196.5 KiB) — OK (headroom: 60.9 KiB)
```

**Edge cases:**

- **No release tag exists**: Delta reporting is skipped with an informational message.
- **Previous tag has no WASM file**: The delta is reported as "baseline unavailable".
- **Budget exceeded**: Delta is still reported even when the contract fails the budget check.

**Step summary:** When running in CI (`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is set), the script writes
a delta table to the GitHub Actions step summary alongside the budget report.

### Optimize step

`stellar contract optimize` runs `wasm-opt -Oz` on the artifact, typically reducing binary
size by 10–30%. CI runs this step and checks the resulting `.optimized.wasm` file as an
informational pass. The hard budget gate runs against the **raw** release artifact so that the
check remains reproducible without the Stellar CLI installed.

## Safe Batch Limits

| Operation | Batch Size | Recommended CPU Budget |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| `create_streams` | 1 | 1.5M |
| `create_streams` | 10 | 10M |
| `create_streams` | 50 | 40M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 1 | 1.0M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 10 | 6M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 50 | 20M |
| `batch_withdraw` | 100 | 35M |
| `batch_withdraw_to` | 1 | 1.0M |
| `batch_withdraw_to` | 10 | 6M |
| `batch_withdraw_to` | 50 | 20M |
| `batch_withdraw_to` | 100 | 35M |
| `bulk_cancel_streams` | 1 | 3.5M |
| `bulk_cancel_streams` | 5 | 9M |
| `bulk_cancel_streams` | 10 | 16M |
| `bulk_cancel_streams` | 20 | 32M |
| `bulk_resume_streams_as_admin` | 1 | 4M |
| `bulk_resume_streams_as_admin` | 5 | 10M |
| `bulk_resume_streams_as_admin` | 10 | 18M |
| `bulk_resume_streams_as_admin` | 20 | 36M |

## Hot Path Analysis

### `withdraw`
The `withdraw` function is the most common operation. Its cost is dominated by:
1. Loading the `Stream` state.
2. Accrual calculation.
3. Token transfer (external call).
4. Saving updated `withdrawn_amount`.

### `batch_withdraw`
To reduce gas, `batch_withdraw` optimizes by:
1. Caching the ledger timestamp.
2. Performing a single authorization check.
3. Processing multiple streams in a loop.
4. Reading `TotalLiabilities` once, decrementing a local accumulator for every
   paid stream, and writing the final value once after the batch succeeds.

At `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 100`, the liability flush changes the hot-path
`TotalLiabilities` instance-storage I/O from 100 reads plus 100 writes to 1 read
plus 1 write, while preserving the same final liability value. The batch remains
atomic: any validation or transfer failure reverts the whole call.

### `bulk_cancel_streams`
`bulk_cancel_streams` uses the same single-flush liability pattern. Recipient
accrual payouts and sender refunds both decrement a local `TotalLiabilities`
accumulator, which is written back once after all streams have been processed.
For a 100-stream cancellation where every stream has both accrued recipient
funds and a sender refund, this reduces liability-slot writes from 200 to 1.

### `batch_withdraw_to`
Identical cost structure to `batch_withdraw` except that each entry carries an explicit per-entry destination address. The additional `WithdrawToParam` struct field has negligible impact on iteration cost.

### O(n²) duplicate-ID scan at MAX_PAGE_SIZE

The four batch entrypoints — `batch_withdraw`, `batch_withdraw_to`, `bulk_resume_streams_as_admin`, and `bulk_cancel_streams` — each validate that their stream-id arguments contain no duplicates before processing.  The current implementation is `reject_duplicate_ids` in `storage.rs`, which uses a nested-loop scan over a `Vec<u64>`:

```rust
for id in stream_ids.iter() {
    for s in seen.iter() {
        if s == id { return Err(DuplicateStreamId); }
        seen.push_back(id);
    }
}
```

This is O(n²) in the batch size n.  At `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 100`, the worst case is about 4 950 element comparisons per call (~10 000 inclusive of the outer-loop overhead).  The regression tests measure `batch_withdraw` and `batch_withdraw_to` at the existing large-batch sizes 1, 10, 50, and 100, and measure `bulk_cancel_streams` plus `bulk_resume_streams_as_admin` at issue #1219's baseline sizes 1, 5, 10, and 20. This keeps the newer bulk entrypoints under `validate_gas.py` regression comparison while preserving the existing large-batch coverage for withdrawal paths.

A companion refactor issue replaces the O(n²) scan with an O(n) helper (e.g. using a `Map<u64,bool>`), after which these baselines are expected to improve significantly, especially at size 100. The budget assertions stay valid regardless; they guard against per-invocation-limit violations, not against algorithmic regressions within the current design.

*Baselines were captured from a clean run of `script/validate_gas.py` against `contracts/stream/tests/gas_regression.rs` on Rust 1.94.1 / soroban-env-host 21.2.1 (see #1201). Costs are deterministic CPU-instruction counts from the metered host and are stable across runs on the same toolchain/SDK pin. Update via the [review bar](#review-bar-for-baseline-increases) below.*

## Governance Operations

The governance contract (`fluxora_governance`) handles proposal creation, approval, and execution with bounded costs to prevent DoS attacks.

### Budget Thresholds

These thresholds are enforced by the gas regression tests in `contracts/governance/tests/gas_regression.rs`. CI will fail if any operation exceeds its budget.

#### Propose

Creating a new proposal stores the calldata and proposal metadata. Cost is independent of signer count since we don't iterate over signers during creation.

| Metric | Threshold | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| CPU Instructions | ≤ 1,000,000 | Independent of calldata size |
| Memory Bytes | ≤ 100,000 | Independent of calldata size |

The calldata is capped at `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes) to keep storage costs reasonable.

#### Approve

Approving a proposal involves checking the signer's membership (O(1) via Map index) and appending to the approvals list. The cost scales linearly with the number of existing approvals since we store them as a Vec.

| Signer Count | CPU Threshold | Memory Threshold |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1-5          | ≤ 375,000 + 75,000 per signer | ≤ 37,500 + 7,500 per signer |
| 6-10         | ≤ 750,000 + 75,000 per signer | ≤ 75,000 + 7,500 per signer |
| 11-20        | ≤ 1,125,000 + 75,000 per signer | ≤ 112,500 + 7,500 per signer |
| Max (20)     | ≤ 1,500,000 | ≤ 150,000 |

**Why it matters**: The approvals list is capped at `MAX_SIGNERS` (20), so the maximum cost is bounded. The O(1) duplicate check via the approval index Map prevents additional scanning overhead.

#### Execute

Executing a proposal processes the stored calldata. The cost scales with calldata size since we need to read and process the payload.

| Calldata Size | CPU Threshold | Memory Threshold |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| 0-1 KB        | ≤ 5,000,000 | ≤ 500,000 |
| 1-2 KB        | ≤ 6,250,000 | ≤ 625,000 |
| 2-3 KB        | ≤ 7,500,000 | ≤ 750,000 |
| 3-4 KB        | ≤ 8,750,000 | ≤ 875,000 |
| Max (4 KB)    | ≤ 10,000,000 | ≤ 1,000,000 |

**Why it matters**: Calldata is capped at `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes), so even the worst-case execute cost is bounded. This prevents malicious proposals from being too expensive to execute.

### Worst-Case Scenario

The most expensive governance operation is executing a proposal with:
- `MAX_SIGNERS` (20) approvals
- `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes) calldata

| Operation | CPU | Memory |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Propose | ≤ 1,000,000 | ≤ 100,000 |
| Approve (all 20) | ≤ 1,500,000 | ≤ 150,000 |
| Execute | ≤ 10,000,000 | ≤ 1,000,000 |

All operations fit comfortably within Soroban's default budget limits.

### Denial of Service Protection

The governance contract is protected against DoS attacks through:

1. **Bounded approvals**: The signer set is capped at `MAX_SIGNERS` (20), making the approval scan O(n) where n ≤ 20.

2. **Bounded calldata**: The calldata payload is capped at `MAX_CALLDATA_BYTES` (4,096 bytes), limiting storage and processing costs.

3. **O(1) lookups**: Signer membership and duplicate approval checks use Map indices, avoiding linear scans of the signer list.

4. **Proposal expiry**: Proposals expire after `MAX_PROPOSAL_AGE_SECONDS` (30 days), preventing accumulation of stale proposals.

### Regression Testing

The gas regression tests run on every PR and CI build:

```bash
cargo test --test gas_regression -- --nocapture
```

#### Stream contract batch entrypoints at MAX_PAGE_SIZE

Four entrypoints that use an O(n²) duplicate-ID scan (`reject_duplicate_ids`) have dedicated gas-regression tests that print `GAS_MEASUREMENT` lines and also assert that the measured CPU-instruction cost stays within the Soroban per-invocation budget (`PER_INVOCATION_CPU_BUDGET = 25 billion = 25% of the 100 billion instruction limit`).  The budget is intentionally generous enough that valid, non-regressed runs pass comfortably, but tight enough relative to a hypothetical worst-case scenario where MAX_PAGE_SIZE were dramatically increased that a future regression would trip the assertion.

```
cargo test -p fluxora_stream gas_regression -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep GAS_MEASUREMENT
```

## Release Hardening

### Gas Baseline Determinism Contract

Gas baselines in the JSON block above are **deterministic** given a fixed toolchain and
SDK pin. Two successive runs on the same machine with the same toolchain produce
byte-identical CPU instruction counts because:

1. **Soroban's metered host uses deterministic CPU accounting.** Instruction counts are
   a property of the compiled WASM bytecode plus the host execution model — not of wall
   time, system load, or OS scheduling. Two runs on the same WASM binary and the same
   `soroban-env-host` version always produce the same integer count.

2. **Rust toolchain is pinned.** `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the compiler to a specific
   version (currently `1.94.1`). A different compiler version can produce a different
   WASM codegen, changing instruction counts. The toolchain pin ensures every CI run and
   local run uses the same compiler.

3. **`soroban-sdk` version is pinned with an exact specifier.** `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml`
   uses an exact version string (e.g. `"21.7.7"`) rather than a caret range (`"^21.7.7"`).
   `Cargo.lock` is committed and validated by the `cargo update --locked` CI gate before
   any WASM build step.

4. **Retry behaviour is identical.** If `script/validate_gas.py` is re-run without any
   code change, it produces the same pass/fail result. The `run_tests()` call re-invokes
   `cargo test`, which re-runs the metered tests with the same binary and the same host
   version. There is no accumulated state between runs.

**Implication for upgrades:** When upgrading the Rust toolchain or `soroban-sdk` version,
the baselines in the JSON block above **must be re-measured and updated** even if no
contract logic changed. A toolchain or SDK change can shift instruction counts by a small
but non-zero amount due to codegen differences. Follow the baseline update procedure in
the [Baseline Update Process](#baseline-update-process) section below.

**Implication for CI flakiness:** If `validate_gas.py` reports a regression that was not
present on the previous run with the same commit, the most likely cause is a toolchain or
environment mismatch. Verify that `rustc --version` matches `rust-toolchain.toml` and that
`cargo test` passes with `--locked`.

### WASM-Size Budget Headroom Update Procedure

The WASM size budgets in `script/check-wasm-size.sh` are set with ~25% headroom above the
sizes measured during the June 2026 baseline audit. When a deliberate feature addition
causes the raw artifact to approach or exceed the current budget:

1. **Build the release WASM locally:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release -p fluxora_stream --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

2. **Measure the new raw size:**
   ```bash
   wc -c target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fluxora_stream.wasm
   ```

3. **Compute the new budget:** Add ~25% headroom to the measured size and round up to the
   nearest 64 KiB boundary:
   ```python
   import math
   measured = <size_in_bytes>
   headroom = math.ceil(measured * 1.25 / 65536) * 65536
   print(f"New budget: {headroom} bytes ({headroom // 1024} KiB)")
   ```

4. **Update `script/check-wasm-size.sh`** with the new budget constant.

5. **Update the budget table in `docs/gas.md`** (the table under "WASM Size Budgets")
   with the new value and a note explaining the change.

6. **Regenerate the WASM checksum:**
   ```bash
   bash script/update-wasm-checksums.sh
   git add wasm/checksums.sha256
   ```

7. **Include in the PR description:** State the measured old size, the new budget, and
   which feature caused the growth.

### Paused-Stream Counter Backfill Edge Case (v5 upgrades)

This edge case is documented in full in `docs/upgrade.md §3` ("Paused-stream counter
backfill caveat"). The gas and operational implications are summarised here:

**Background:** `CONTRACT_VERSION = 5` introduced `DataKey::PausedStreamCount` — an
instance-level O(1) counter of how many streams are currently in `Paused` status. This
counter is maintained by `pause_stream`, `pause_stream_as_admin`, `resume_stream`,
`resume_stream_as_admin`, `cancel_stream`, `cancel_stream_as_admin`, and
`close_completed_stream`.

**What happens on upgrade from v4 to v5 (or v6/v7):**

- An instance upgraded from v4 starts with `PausedStreamCount` unset (reads as 0).
- Legacy streams that were `Paused` before the upgrade are **not** counted.
- The counter becomes accurate only for streams that experience a pause/resume/cancel
  transition _after_ the upgrade.
- `resume_*` and `cancel_*` applied to a pre-upgrade paused stream do **not** decrement
  below zero — the implementation uses saturating subtraction.

**Gas implications:**

- `get_paused_stream_count()` is O(1) and its cost does not change with the number of
  paused streams. It reads a single instance storage entry.
- The saturation guard in `cancel_*` / `resume_*` for legacy paused streams adds one
  additional instance storage read (to load the current counter before the saturating
  decrement). This is negligible (~1 instruction) and is not separately measured in the
  gas baselines above.

**Operational requirement:**

If an exact paused-stream count is required immediately after upgrading a live instance
from v4, reconstruct it off-chain by enumerating all stream states and treat
`get_paused_stream_count()` as authoritative only for post-upgrade transitions. See
`docs/upgrade.md §3` for the full recovery procedure.

## Baseline Update Process

Gas-regression tests assert that our operations don't unexpectedly increase in CPU instruction count or memory usage. A legitimate baseline bump may be required when intentionally adding features or security checks that increase the cost.

### How the Baseline is Computed and Stored

We currently have two different mechanisms for tracking and asserting gas baselines across our contracts:

1. **Governance (`fluxora_governance`)**:
   - **Stored**: Baselines are stored directly as hardcoded `const` values at the top of `contracts/governance/tests/gas_regression.rs`.
   - **Computed**: These constants represent an absolute threshold. Historically, they were computed by running the tests and adding ~25% headroom. The test suite fails via standard `assert!` statements if the measured budget exceeds these constants.

2. **Stream (`fluxora_stream`)**:
   - **Stored**: Baselines are stored in a JSON block inside `docs/gas.md` (between `<!-- GAS_BASELINE_START -->` and `<!-- GAS_BASELINE_END -->` tags).
   - **Computed**: The test file (`contracts/stream/tests/gas_regression.rs`) prints the costs. A Python script (`script/validate_gas.py`) parses these prints and compares them against the JSON baseline in `docs/gas.md`. It fails the CI if any measurement exceeds the recorded baseline by more than 5%. To update the baseline, run the tests and copy the new measured values into the JSON block in this document.

### Review Bar for Baseline Increases

Baseline increases are not granted automatically. To get a baseline increase approved, the PR must meet the following review bar:

- **Explicit Justification**: The PR description must explicitly justify the gas increase.
- **Root Cause**: The increase must be tied to a specific, legitimate change (e.g., adding a new necessary security check, expanding a feature).
- **No Hidden Costs**: Unintended or unexplainable jumps in gas usage must be optimized or reverted. You cannot blindly bump the baseline to get CI to pass.

## Keeper Economics

`keeper_cancel` pays keeper bots a small incentive (fee) to cancel streams that have passed
their `end_time` but whose sender never called `cancel_stream`, preventing unclaimed deposits
from being locked in contract storage indefinitely.  Understanding the relationship between
that fee and the transaction's own resource cost is essential for keeper-bot operators who
need to know which streams are worth cancelling.

### How the fee is calculated

The fee is taken from the unstreamed portion of the deposit (the *sender's gross refund*).
See [docs/cancel-stream-semantics.md](cancel-stream-semantics.md#keeper-initiated-cancellation-keeper_cancel)
for the full distribution formula and [docs/formal-verification.md](formal-verification.md#constants-production-values)
for the constant definitions.

```
accrued          = calculate_accrued_at(end_time)        -- capped at deposit_amount
recipient_amount = accrued - withdrawn_amount
sender_refund_gross = deposit_amount - accrued           -- unstreamed portion
keeper_fee       = sender_refund_gross × KEEPER_FEE_BPS / 10 000
sender_refund    = sender_refund_gross - keeper_fee
```

Production constants:

| Constant                        | Value            | Source                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `KEEPER_FEE_BPS`                | 50 (0.5 %)       | `lib.rs`, `formal-verification.md` |
| `KEEPER_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS`   | 604 800 (7 days) | `lib.rs`, `formal-verification.md` |

### CPU-instruction cost

`keeper_cancel` in the common case (partial accrual, 3 token transfers) is more expensive
than a plain `withdraw` because it:

1. Validates grace-period eligibility.
2. Performs the keeper-fee arithmetic.
3. Issues **three** separate token transfers: recipient, sender, and keeper.

The gas regression tests in `contracts/stream/tests/gas_regression.rs` measure two variants:

| Variant           | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `partial_accrual` | `deposit_amount > rate × duration` → 3 token transfers (common keeper incentive path) |
| `fully_accrued`   | `deposit_amount == rate × duration` → 1 token transfer, `keeper_fee = 0` |

Run the measurements with:

```bash
cargo test -p fluxora_stream gas_regression -- --nocapture
```

The measured CPU instruction counts are recorded in the JSON baseline above
(`keeper_cancel.partial_accrual` and `keeper_cancel.fully_accrued`) and validated
on every CI run by `script/validate_gas.py`.

### Break-even stream size

A keeper-bot only profits when the fee it earns exceeds the Stellar resource fee it pays
to submit the transaction.  The minimum *unstreamed refund* that makes a keeper_cancel
call economically rational is:

```
break_even_unstreamed = (resource_fee_in_tokens × 10 000) / KEEPER_FEE_BPS
                      = resource_fee_in_tokens × 200
```

At `KEEPER_FEE_BPS = 50` (0.5 %), the keeper earns 1 token for every 200 tokens of
unstreamed refund.  Below this threshold the fee is smaller than the cost of the
transaction itself and a rational keeper should not bother.

Representative break-even values for USDC streams (7 decimal places, 1 USDC = 10 000 000
stroops):

| Stellar resource fee (USDC) | Break-even unstreamed refund (USDC) |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 0.001                       | 0.20                               |
| 0.01                        | 2.00                               |
| 0.10                        | 20.00                              |
| 1.00                        | 200.00                             |

> **How to read this table**: at a resource fee of 0.01 USDC per transaction, a keeper
> earns nothing (or loses money) on a stream whose unstreamed balance is less than
> **2.00 USDC**.  At a 1.00 USDC resource fee the break-even unstreamed balance rises to
> **200.00 USDC**.

Actual Stellar resource fees vary with network congestion and the fee-market.  Keeper
operators should periodically re-evaluate their configured minimum stream sizes against
current fee levels.

### Implications for stream design

Stream creators can use the break-even formula to reason about keeper incentives:

- **Large, long-running streams** with significant unstreamed balances at expiry will
  always attract keeper cleanup because the incentive exceeds typical transaction costs.
- **Small or tightly-scoped streams** (deposit ≈ rate × duration, little unstreamed
  balance) may not attract keeper cleanup; senders of such streams should call
  `cancel_stream` themselves rather than relying on keeper bots.
- The 7-day grace period (`KEEPER_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS`) gives senders a window to
  self-clean before keepers become eligible.

### Security notes

- The keeper fee is taken **only** from the sender's gross refund; the recipient's
  accrued balance is never reduced.  See the security invariants in
  [docs/cancel-stream-semantics.md](cancel-stream-semantics.md#security-invariants).
- Keepers must sign (`keeper.require_auth()`), preventing a third party from
  redirecting the fee to an arbitrary address.
- CEI ordering ensures the stream is marked `Cancelled` before any token transfer,

## Stream Persistent-Entry Size

Every `Stream` struct is written to a Soroban **persistent** ledger entry.  Soroban charges
rent proportional to the serialized byte size of each entry, so unchecked growth of any
caller-controlled field inflates the per-stream rent cost for the entire protocol.

### Field breakdown (worst case)

| Category | Fields | Approx. XDR bytes |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed scalars | `stream_id` (u64), 3 × i128 amounts, 3 × i128 checkpoints, 3 × u32 ledger stamps, `delegation_depth` (u32) | ~120 |
| Fixed addresses | `sender`, `recipient` (each 36 bytes) | ~72 |
| Enum fields | `status` (StreamStatus), `kind` (StreamKind) | ~8 |
| Optional scalars | `cancelled_at` (Option\<u64\>), `is_pooled` (Option\<bool\>), `irrevocable` (Option\<bool\>), `parent_stream_id` (Option\<u64\>) | ~30 |
| Optional addresses | `claim_owner` (Option\<Address\>), `witness` (Option\<Address\>) | ~74 |
| **`memo`** (caller-controlled) | `Option<Bytes>` capped at `MAX_MEMO_BYTES` = 256 | **~268** |
| **`metadata`** (caller-controlled) | `Option<Map<Bytes,Bytes>>` capped at `MAX_METADATA_BYTES` = 512 aggregate + ScMap framing for up to 8 entries | **~680** |
| ScVal type tags + XDR padding | per-field overhead from Soroban encoding | ~100 |
| **Structural total** | | **~1 352** |

### Measured baselines

These values are printed by the regression tests in
`contracts/stream/tests/gas_regression.rs` (run with `--nocapture`).  Update this
table whenever the constant or test output changes.

| Variant | Serialized bytes | Test name |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (no optional fields) | ~480 | `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_baseline` |
| Memo only (`MAX_MEMO_BYTES` = 256 B) | ~760 | `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_memo_only` |
| Metadata only (`MAX_METADATA_BYTES` = 512 B) | ~1 160 | `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_metadata_only` |
| **Worst case (memo + metadata + all optionals)** | **~1 352** | `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_worst_case` |

### Ceiling constant

```rust
pub const MAX_STREAM_ENTRY_BYTES: usize = 4_096;  // lib.rs
```

The ceiling is **4 096 bytes** — a ~2.9× safety margin above the ~1 352-byte worst-case
structural total.  The generous margin accounts for:

- Future additive fields that do not require a `CONTRACT_VERSION` bump
- Soroban ScVal type tags, XDR padding, and length prefixes that vary by SDK version
- Host-side encoding overhead not directly observable from Rust test code

### Enforcement

The constant is enforced by:

```bash
cargo test -p fluxora_stream --test gas_regression -- --nocapture
```

Four tests run and each asserts `serialized_len <= MAX_STREAM_ENTRY_BYTES`:

| Test | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_worst_case` | All optional fields at maximum size |
| `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_baseline` | No optional fields (lower bound) |
| `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_memo_only` | Only `memo` at `MAX_MEMO_BYTES` |
| `test_stream_entry_xdr_size_metadata_only` | Only `metadata` at `MAX_METADATA_BYTES` |

### How to update the ceiling

If the `Stream` struct gains new fields and the regression test fails:

1. Run `cargo test -p fluxora_stream --test gas_regression -- --nocapture` and note
   the printed `STREAM_XDR_SIZE: worst_case: N bytes` value.
2. Add **~25% headroom**, round up to the next 512-byte boundary.
3. Update `MAX_STREAM_ENTRY_BYTES` in `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs`.
4. Update the measured-baselines table above with the new figures.
5. Confirm the `CONTRACT_VERSION` policy in `lib.rs` has been followed for the
   struct change (additive fields require a version bump).
6. Include the change in the PR description with an explicit justification.
