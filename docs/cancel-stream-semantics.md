# cancel_stream: refund and cancelled_at semantics

This note scopes and verifies one protocol slice: cancellation refund behavior and `cancelled_at` semantics.

## Irrevocable Mode

For specific use-cases (e.g., token-vesting agreements without clawback clauses, or compliance-grade irrevocable streams), a stream can be marked as **irrevocable** at creation time.

When `irrevocable` is set to `true` (via `CreateStreamParams` or `CreateStreamRelativeParams`), the stream becomes permanently shielded against all cancellation paths. The `irrevocable` flag is structurally appended to the `Stream` XDR as an `Option<bool>` to preserve backward compatibility (defaulting to `false` for older entries).

### Blocked Operations on Irrevocable Streams
Attempting to invoke any of the following endpoints on an irrevocable stream will fail with `ContractError::Unauthorized`:

1. **`cancel_stream`**: The sender cannot unilaterally cancel the stream and reclaim unvested tokens.
2. **`cancel_stream_as_admin`**: Even the protocol admin is blocked from cancelling the stream.
3. **`keeper_cancel`**: Third-party keepers cannot cancel the stream if it's left abandoned past the grace period.
4. **`bulk_cancel_streams`**: Attempting to include an irrevocable stream in a bulk cancellation will abort the entire batch.
5. **`shorten_stream_end_time`**: The sender cannot arbitrarily move the end time forward to effectively cut off the recipient.

### Unaffected Operations
Irrevocable streams behave normally for all other operations:
- **`withdraw`**: The recipient can withdraw accrued tokens continuously.
- **`pause_stream` / `resume_stream`**: If the protocol allows pausing for operational reasons, pausing is still supported (unless restricted elsewhere).

### Security and Trust Assurances
The `irrevocable` flag ensures that a beneficiary (recipient) can mathematically trust that the tokens allocated to them via the stream's rate and duration will be delivered unconditionally as long as they accrue, regardless of the sender's or admin's future intentions. This is a strict requirement for high-trust vesting distributions.

## Scope

In scope:

1. `cancel_stream`, `cancel_stream_as_admin`, and `witnessed_cancel_stream` success/failure behavior.
2. Authorization boundaries for sender/admin/unauthorized actors.
3. On-chain observables: stream storage fields, token balances, errors, events.
4. Time and status edge cases that affect refund and accrued freeze logic.

Out of scope:

1. Token contract implementation safety beyond SEP-41 assumptions.
2. Off-chain indexer uptime and ingestion correctness.
3. Broader stream lifecycle behavior unrelated to cancellation.

## Protocol semantics

On success:

1. Cancellation is allowed only for `Active` or `Paused` streams.
2. `cancelled_at` is set to current ledger timestamp.
3. Stream status becomes terminal `Cancelled`.
4. Refund transferred to sender is:

   `deposit_amount - accrued_at(cancelled_at)`

5. Accrued value is frozen at `cancelled_at` for all future `calculate_accrued` calls.
6. Event emitted: topic `("cancelled", stream_id)` with payload `StreamEvent::StreamCancelled(stream_id)`.

On failure:

1. Missing stream: `StreamNotFound`.
2. Invalid status (`Completed` or already `Cancelled`): `InvalidState`.
3. Sender path requires sender auth; admin path requires admin auth.
4. Failures are atomic: no transfer, no state update, no cancel event. This includes bulk cancellations (`bulk_cancel_streams`), which strictly follow an atomic-reject model: if any stream in a batch fails validation (e.g., unauthorized access or invalid state), the entire batch reverts and no streams are mutated.

## Authorization matrix

1. Sender may call `cancel_stream` for their stream.
2. Admin may call `cancel_stream_as_admin` for any stream.
3. Recipient and third parties cannot cancel without the required auth proof.
4. A configured compliance witness may call `witnessed_cancel_stream` with a valid
   off-chain ed25519 attestation (see below).

## Witnessed compliance cancellation (`witnessed_cancel_stream`)

### Purpose

Allows a per-stream compliance witness (e.g. a sanctions-screening oracle) to cancel
a stream via an off-chain signed attestation, without granting that oracle full protocol
admin authority.

### Configuration

- Optional `witness: Option<Address>` on `Stream` / `CreateStreamParams`, default `None`.
- Set at stream creation via `create_stream(..., witness)` or batch `create_streams`.
- Existing streams without the field decode with `witness = None` (forward-compatible).

### Signature payload

Domain-separated from `delegated_withdraw` to prevent cross-protocol replay:

```
fluxora_witnessed_cancel | stream_id (8 bytes BE) | deadline (8 bytes BE)
```

The witness signs with their ed25519 private key; the submitter passes
`witness_public_key`, `deadline`, and `witness_signature`. The public key must derive
to the stored `witness` address.

### Behavior

Identical to `cancel_stream` on success:

1. Allowed only for `Active` or `Paused` streams.
2. Refund to sender: `deposit_amount - accrued_at(cancelled_at)`.
3. Event: topic `("cancelled", stream_id)` with `StreamEvent::StreamCancelled(stream_id)`.
4. No `require_auth()` on the submitter — authorization is the signature check.

### Errors

| Condition | Error |
| --- | --- |
| Expired deadline | `SignatureDeadlineExpired` |
| No witness configured | `InvalidParams` |
| Public key mismatch | `InvalidSignature` |
| Invalid stream status | `InvalidState` |
| Missing stream | `StreamNotFound` |

### Security invariants

1. Witness signatures cannot be replayed as `delegated_withdraw` authorizations (distinct domain tag and payload layout).
2. `delegated_withdraw` signatures cannot authorize witnessed cancellation.
3. Double cancellation fails with `InvalidState` (signature replay after success is harmless).
4. CEI ordering inherited from shared `cancel_stream_internal` implementation.

## Optional Cancellation Fee

All streams may specify an optional cancellation fee (in basis points, where 1 bps = 0.01% and 10000 bps = 100%).

### Fee Semantics

The cancellation fee is applied **only** to the unstreamed refund portion:

1. When a stream is cancelled, the protocol calculates:

   ```
   accrued_at_cancel = calculate_accrued_at(cancelled_at)
   refund_gross = deposit_amount - accrued_at_cancel
   ```

2. If `cancellation_fee_bps > 0`, the fee is calculated as:

   ```
   fee = (refund_gross × cancellation_fee_bps) / 10000  (rounded down)
   refund_net = refund_gross - fee
   ```

3. The sender receives `refund_net` tokens.

4. **CRITICAL INVARIANT**: The recipient's frozen accrued amount is **never** reduced by the fee.
   - Recipient can always withdraw the full `accrued_at_cancel` via `withdraw()` or `withdraw_to()`
   - The fee is taken **only** from the sender's refund

### Edge Cases & Rounding

1. **Zero fee**: If `cancellation_fee_bps = 0`, no fee is applied; sender receives full refund.

2. **100% fee**: If `cancellation_fee_bps = 10000` (100%), the entire refund is deducted as fee; sender receives 0 tokens.

3. **No refund**: If stream is fully accrued (`accrued_at_cancel == deposit_amount`), then `refund_gross = 0`, so fee = 0, and sender gets nothing (as expected).

4. **Rounding**: Fee is calculated as integer division `(refund_gross × fee_bps) / 10000`, which truncates down. This ensures the sender never receives more tokens than the protocol allows and prevents dust accumulation.

5. **Zero refund**, any fee: If `refund_gross = 0`, then fee = 0 (regardless of `fee_bps`).

### Recipient Safety

The recipient's ability to withdraw accrued funds is **completely independent** of the cancellation fee:

- `calculate_accrued()` returns the full accrued amount, unaffected by the fee.
- The fee is deducted from the sender's refund, **not** from the recipient's accrued balance.
- After cancellation, the recipient calls `withdraw()` to claim the full accrued amount.

### Examples

**Example 1: 50% cancellation fee, cancel at 30% accrual**

- Deposit: 1000 tokens, Rate: 1 token/sec, End: 1000 sec
- Cancel at: 300 sec
- Accrued: 300 tokens
- Refund gross: 700 tokens
- Fee (50%): (700 × 5000) / 10000 = 350 tokens
- Refund net: 350 tokens
- Sender receives: 350 tokens
- Recipient can withdraw: 300 tokens (full accrued)
- Unaccounted (fee): 350 tokens (remains in contract)

**Example 2: 10% cancellation fee, fully accrued stream**

- Deposit: 1000, Rate: 1/sec, End: 1000 sec, Cancel at: 1000 sec
- Accrued: 1000 tokens
- Refund gross: 0 tokens
- Fee: 0 tokens
- Refund net: 0 tokens
- Sender receives: 0 tokens
- Recipient can withdraw: 1000 tokens

## Keeper-initiated cancellation (`keeper_cancel`)

### Purpose

Streams that have passed their `end_time` but whose sender never calls `cancel_stream` leave
unclaimed deposits locked in contract storage indefinitely, contributing to state bloat.
`keeper_cancel` allows any caller (a permissionless keeper) to cancel such a stream once a
configurable grace period has elapsed, returning funds to their rightful owners and paying a
small incentive to the keeper.

### Eligibility

A stream is eligible for keeper cancellation when:

1. Its status is `Active` or `Paused` (not already `Completed` or `Cancelled`).
2. `current_timestamp >= end_time + KEEPER_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS` (default: 7 days = 604 800 s).

### Token distribution

```
accrued         = calculate_accrued_at(end_time)          -- capped at deposit_amount
recipient_amount = accrued - withdrawn_amount              -- outstanding claimable balance
sender_refund_gross = deposit_amount - accrued             -- unstreamed portion
keeper_fee       = sender_refund_gross × KEEPER_FEE_BPS / 10 000   -- default: 0.5 %
sender_refund    = sender_refund_gross - keeper_fee
```

All three parties receive their tokens in a single transaction.

### Security invariants

1. **Recipient is never penalised**: `keeper_fee` is taken from `sender_refund_gross`, never from
   `recipient_amount`. The recipient always receives the full outstanding accrued balance.
2. **CEI ordering**: the stream is marked `Cancelled` in persistent storage before any token
   transfer. A re-entrant token cannot observe an inconsistent state.
3. **Keeper must sign (`keeper.require_auth()`)**: prevents a third party from redirecting the fee
   to an arbitrary address by supplying a different keeper address in the call.
4. **Terminal streams are rejected early**: if the stream is already `Completed` or `Cancelled`,
   the call fails with `ContractError::InvalidState` before any state change.

### Event

Topic: `("kp_cncl", stream_id)`

Payload: `KeeperCancelled { stream_id, keeper, keeper_fee, recipient_amount, sender_refund }`

### Constants

| Constant                      | Value            | Meaning                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `KEEPER_GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS` | 604 800 (7 days) | Minimum seconds past `end_time` for eligibility       |
| `KEEPER_FEE_BPS`              | 50 (0.5 %)       | Keeper fee as basis points of the sender gross refund |

## Residual assumptions and risks

1. Token trust model: cancellation depends on configured token contract transfer behavior.
2. CEI ordering reduces reentrancy risk by persisting cancel state before transfer, but cannot fully mitigate a malicious token that violates assumptions.
3. Event payload does not include refund amount, fee, or timestamp; indexers must read stream state to reconstruct these values.
4. Cancellation fee is optional (defaults to 0); protocol behavior is identical to pre-fee version when `cancellation_fee_bps = 0`.

## Permissionless cleanup: `close_cancelled_stream`

When a stream has been `Cancelled` and the recipient has withdrawn the frozen accrued
amount, the contract exposes a permissionless cleanup entrypoint `close_cancelled_stream`.

- Purpose: reclaim persistent storage and remove the stream ID from the recipient index
  after the recipient is fully settled.
- Preconditions: stream must be `Cancelled` and the recipient must have no remaining
  claimable balance at `cancelled_at` (the call rejects with `InvalidState` otherwise).
- Event: emits `("closed", stream_id)` with `StreamEvent::StreamClosed(stream_id)`
  before deleting storage.

Keepers and off-chain indexers may call this entrypoint to free storage and reduce
recipient-index bloat once the recipient's claims are fully settled.

## CliffOnly Cancellation Semantics

When `StreamKind::CliffOnly` streams are cancelled (via `cancel_stream`, `cancel_stream_as_admin`, `bulk_cancel_streams`, or `keeper_cancel`), they exhibit distinct mathematical edge cases compared to `Linear` streams because partial accrual is impossible:

1. **Before the cliff time:** The recipient's accrued amount is strictly 0. 
   - A cancellation refunds the **full** `deposit_amount` back to the sender (`sender_refund_gross == deposit_amount`).
   - For a `bulk_cancel_streams` (admin only) or sender cancellation, the sender receives the entire deposit minus any configured cancellation fee. The recipient receives nothing.

2. **At or after the cliff time:** The recipient's accrued amount is the **full** `deposit_amount`.
   - A cancellation (e.g. via `keeper_cancel` after `end_time + GRACE`) calculates `sender_refund_gross = 0`.
   - Because `sender_refund_gross` is 0, the `keeper_fee` evaluates to 0, and the sender receives a net refund of 0.
   - The recipient is fully entitled to the `deposit_amount` and can withdraw it at their leisure.

In all paths, `TotalLiabilities`, `KeeperCancelled`, and `StreamCancelled` events operate correctly, preserving the structural invariants proven in adversarial test suites (`contracts/stream/tests/cliff_only_variant.rs`).
